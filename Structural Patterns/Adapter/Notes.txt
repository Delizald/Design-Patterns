Convert the interface of a class into another interface clients expect. 
Adapter lets classes work together that couldn't otherwise because of incompatible interfaces.

The classes and objects participating in this pattern are:

Target: defines the domain-specific interface that Client uses.
Adapter: adapts the interface Adaptee to the Target interface.
Adaptee: defines an existing interface that needs adapting.
Client: collaborates with objects conforming to the Target interface.

Wrap an existing class with a new interface.
